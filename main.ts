// Question no 25. Alien Colors #1:
//  Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called
// alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
// • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the
// player just earned 5 points.
// • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that
// fails will have no output.)

// passed version of Green alien colour
let alien_color = ("Green");
if (alien_color == "Green"){
    console.log("you just earn 5 points ");
};


// Fail version 

 alien_color = ("Yellow");
if (alien_color == "Green"){
    console.log("you just earn 5 points ");
    // no out because condition is false
};
